## Description
This project is a back end for an e-commerce website built using Express.js and Sequelize, allowing managers at an internet retail company to manage their products, categories, and tags.


## Acceptance Criteria
1. Given a functional Express.js API, when I add my database name, PostgreSQL username, and PostgreSQL password to an environment variable file, then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
2. When I enter schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
3. When I enter the command to invoke the application, then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the PostgreSQL database.
4. When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
5. When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
